# Cube Conflict

Cube Conflict is a fork of Tesseract (http://tesseract.gg) which is a fork of the Cube 2: Sauerbraten (http://sauerbraten.org).

The goal is to make a free, open-source, fun, and complete game able to run smoothly even on low-end computers.
Available here and soon on Steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1454700/Cube_Conflict/

# Current Content

- More than 10 items to use ingame (different shields, boosts, super-weapons, etc.)
- 6 themed maps, from the moon with reduced gravity to the volcano and its molten lava.
- 8 different atmospheres (night, heat wave, rain, sunset, etc.) for outdoor maps.

# Platforms
Available on Windows and Linux.

very last version of the game, it is preferable to build the binary by yourself
("make -C src install" in the main folder)
