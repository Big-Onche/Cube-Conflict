## Some tips

* For the quote text (ex: `This is a "cool" feauters`) you need to use `^` before `"` (ex: `This is a ^"cool^" feauters`).
* For the new line use `^n` (ex: `Hey!^nI kill you!`).
* For the colorized text use `^f{PREFIX}` (ex: `^f5 This is a blue text! ^fb This is not.`) and `^fb` for close colored block.
    * Yellow - `f0`
    * Light blue - `f1`
    * Red - `f3`
    * Blue - `f5`
    * Orange - `f6`
    * Dark blue - `ff`
    * Green - 'fj'
